## Does It Backup Everything? $${\color{gold}backupregistry.ps1}$$

    
    What It Covers:
    
        System Hives:
        
            HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM
            
            HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE
            
            HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY
            
            HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM
            
            HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT
            
        User-Specific Hives:
        
            HKEY_CURRENT_USER (derived from HKEY_USERS\<SID>).

 ##   These hives are backed up into .hiv files, providing a snapshot of the registry data.

    What It Doesn't Cover During Runtime:
        Volatile Keys: Some keys exist only in memory and aren't saved to disk, such as:
            HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\HARDWARE
            Certain temporary configurations created by active processes.
        Locked Keys: If a key is actively locked by a critical process (e.g., kernel-level operations), reg save might skip it.

    To Truly Get Everything:
      If you want every single registry key, including volatile and runtime keys:
            Perform an offline backup by copying the raw registry hive files from:

          C:\Windows\System32\Config

            Files to back up:
                SYSTEM
                SOFTWARE
                SECURITY
                SAM
                DEFAULT
                NTUSER.DAT (for user-specific settings).
                UsrClass.dat (application-specific settings).

## Restoring the Registry

To restore a hive from the backup, you can use reg restore:

`reg restore "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM" "C:\RegistryBackup\SYSTEM.hiv"`

## Offline Backup for Complete Coverage
 If the system is offline, the most comprehensive method is to copy the raw registry hive files directly:
 Steps for Offline Backup:

    Boot into a recovery environment or connect the drive to another system.
    Navigate to:

    C:\Windows\System32\Config

    Copy the following files to a backup location:
        SYSTEM
        SOFTWARE
        SECURITY
        SAM
        DEFAULT
    For user-specific data, also back up:
        C:\Users\<username>\NTUSER.DAT
        C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\UsrClass.dat

## Advantages of Offline Backup:

    Captures every key, including those inaccessible or volatile during runtime.
    Ensures no key is skipped due to system locks.
